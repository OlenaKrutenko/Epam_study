It still feels like our first night together
Feels like the first kiss and it's gettin' better...
No one can better this
Iâ€™m still holdin' on and you're still the one
The first time our eyes met - it's the same feelin...
Only feels much stronger - i wanna love ya longer
You still turn the fire on...
