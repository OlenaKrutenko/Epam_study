It still feels like our first night together
Feels like the first kiss and it's gettin' better...
No one can better this
Iâ€™m still holdin' on and you're still the one
The first time our eyes met - it's the same feelin...
Only feels much stronger - i wanna love ya longer
You still turn the fire on...
So if you're feelin' lonely..don't 
You're the only one i'd ever want
I only wanna make it good 
So if i love ya - a little more than i should

Please forgive me - I know not what I do
Please forgive me - I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me - this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me - if I need you like I do
Please believe me - every word I say is true
Please forgive me - I can't stop loving you
Chorus
